## Description

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-green)](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

## Python

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        ite = head
        while ite:
            tmp = ite.next
            while tmp and tmp.val == ite.val:
                tmp = tmp.next
            ite.next = tmp
            ite = ite.next
        return head
```
