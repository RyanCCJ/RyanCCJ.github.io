## Description

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-green)](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:
```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

## Python

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not p and not q: return True
        elif not p or not q: return False
        elif p.val != q.val: return False
        else: return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```
