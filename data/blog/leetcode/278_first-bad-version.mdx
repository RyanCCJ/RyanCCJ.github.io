## Description

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-green)](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

## Python
Approach 1:
```python
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, n
        while left <= right:
            middle = (left + right) // 2
            if isBadVersion(middle):
                if middle==1 or not isBadVersion(middle-1):
                    return middle
                else:
                    right = middle - 1
            else:
                left = middle + 1
        return None
```

Approach 2:
```python
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, n-1
        while left <= right:
            middle = (left + right) // 2
            if isBadVersion(middle):
                right = middle - 1
            else:
                left = middle + 1
        return left
```
