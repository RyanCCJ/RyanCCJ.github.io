## Description

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-yellow)](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10^9`.

Example 1:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

Example 2:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= m, n <= 100`

## Python

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[ 0 for i in range(m)] for j in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][0] = 1
        for i in range(m):
            dp[0][i] = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]
        return dp[n-1][m-1]
```
