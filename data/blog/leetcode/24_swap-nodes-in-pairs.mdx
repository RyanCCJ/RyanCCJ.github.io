## Description

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-yellow)](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100].
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Python
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        swap, first = True, True
        prev, curr , res = None, head, head
        while curr:
            if swap and curr.next:
                tmp = curr.next
                curr.next = tmp.next
                tmp.next = curr
                if prev:
                    prev.next = tmp
                prev = tmp
                if first:
                    res = prev
                    first = False
            else:
                prev = curr
                curr = curr.next
            swap = not swap
        return res
```
