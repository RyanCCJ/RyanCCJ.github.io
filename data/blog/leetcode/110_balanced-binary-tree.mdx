## Description

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-green)](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, determine if it is **height-balanced**.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`

## Python

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def check(root: TreeNode) -> int:
            if not root: return 0
            l_height = check(root.left)
            r_height = check(root.right)
            if l_height==-1 or r_height==-1 or abs(l_height-r_height)>1:
                return -1
            return max(l_height, r_height) + 1
        return check(root) != -1
