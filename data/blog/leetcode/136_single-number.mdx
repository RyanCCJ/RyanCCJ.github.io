## Description

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-green)](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

## Python

### XOR

- a XOR a = 0, 0 XOR a = a, a XOR 0 = a
- XOR has **Commutative Law** and **Associative Law**
- 0 XOR a XOR b XOR c XOR b XOR a = c

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in nums:
            res ^= i
        return res
```
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Run Time: 112ms (52.37%)
- Memory: 19.12MB (34.03%)
