## Description

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Easy-green)](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Example 1:
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

-  `0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1`

## Python
```python
class Solution:
    def hammingDistance(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        xor  = x ^ y
        res = 0
        while xor:
            res += xor & 1
            xor >>= 1
        return res
```
